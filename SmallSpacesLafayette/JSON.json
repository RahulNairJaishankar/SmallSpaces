This piece is a recreation of “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,” which is on display at the Art Institute in Chicago. Medler mentioned that one of his motifs throughout his artwork, which is evident in this piece, is to take classic paintings and add a twist to them. This specific art piece is on an extremely large scale, completely viewable from the street and surrounds Bernadette’s Barbershop. The size, location and artwork itself brings an artistic vibe to an artistic business. When you look closely, you can see that the characters in the artwork are on mobile devices, showing Medler’s thoughts on how technology is absorbing our lives.",

Throughout the city of Lafayette, you will see many different signs posted up, and most of these signs were created by Aaron. This particular piece is posted up on a street post, making it necessary for you to look up to see the artwork. Located right next to a stoplight at an intersection, it is put in the perfect spot for cars passing by to see as well as pedestrians walking the street. The signs all say different things, and are usually are positive messages or compliments such as this one. Try going around the city to find some of Aaron's other signs!",

She has a personal passion for patterns, which she featured in this piece. The geometry of the art interacts with the geometry of the building beyond just the lines of the panes of glass. For example, the wide red line is an extension of the fire escape stairway, and several of the lines run parallel to that. The teal pattern section not only relates to the stairway, but appears to come out of the vent. This piece incorporates components of the building with the art which joins the canvas with the content. Missing and broken sections of glass just further the relationship between the art and the building and add to the abstract, jagged geometry.",

His traditional tattoo style is clearly apparent in this piece, brightening up the wall. It is painted on a boarded up window from the Haywood Printing Co. Inc, directly next to a mural painted by another co-owner of The Tattooed Heart, Robert Brumbaugh. The styles and colors compliment each other well and add a bit of cohesiveness to the street art. Most pieces vary in design and colors from one to the next, which is expected from the variety of people painting them. However, these two pieces are so consistent and interrelated, it is tough to not to be drawn to both. This piece, along with the other, work extremely well with the space, adding a bright and cartoonish atmosphere to an otherwise bland and old building.",

With windows on all sides, this building is home to many of the Small Spaces artworks. This piece in particular highlights one of the main initiatives of Small Spaces. Brumbaugh, a local tattoo artist, was sought out by Medler in order to showcase artists from the Lafayette community. Brumbaugh’s style is inherited from classic sailor tattoos, and those motifs are evident in this piece. Combined with the surrounding artworks and Brumbaugh’s, Small Spaces has completely transformed an old factory building into a notable community gathering place. With local flair and international variety, Small Spaces has taken a normal building and brought creativity to the city of Lafayette.",

The face in this art piece belongs to the well-known movie star, Clint Eastwood. His green undertones and customary Clint Eastwood stern gaze bring to life your favorite cowboy, drill sergeant, or astronaut. Definitely the most awe inspiring piece in the row, Burdick’s painting naturally draws you back toward the old warehouse as Eastwood’s gaze follows you down the street. Along with the other pieces of art, this painting puts life back into an otherwise plain building. If you notice the archway the painting is in, Eastwood appears to guard the building from what could possibly be an old entrance to the building.",

This image connects to the strong ties the city of Lafayette has with the railroad. Profant’s artistic talent is shown in this image with an amazing glowing light on the front of the train and a serene alpine landscape in the background. Surrounded by grim images, Profant’s painting brings a lighter, happier element to the street while bringing to life a large, steam powered train. The enthusiastic face on the train makes you smile and remember your childhood experiences. This work of art could depict the green train engine Henry from the Thomas the Tank Engine series, who once had a red overcoat on him.",

Just a few years ago his goal of reenergizing and reconnecting his hometown with street art has now become a reality, as Zach continues to work on and grow Small Spaces Lafayette. His piece seen here, called, “American Neo-Gothic” is inspired by Grant Wood’s “American Gothic,” a wildly famous and often parodied 20th century painting. Notice how Zach integrates the air conditioner and locates it on the second floor of the house, as it at first glance appears to be a window or regular aspect of the house. Medler’s piece, surrounded by a barren and industrialized area of Lafayette, won’t scream out at you, but is brilliantly done by juxtaposing the “old” versus the “new,” in reference to the technologically dependent society we live in today.",

She likes to create creatures with a story, and asks viewers to discover the stories, or “simply enjoy the cuteness” as stated in one of her interviews. This particular mural depicts TOWBY, which is an acronym for “the one who was born yesterday”, on the Haywood Printing Building, near Bernadette’s Barbershop as part of a larger collection of works. Bethany’s unique art style distinguishes this work from others nearby as the adorable and lovable TOWBY, provides a strong contrast to the grim Clint Eastwood mural, and the ironic painting by Zach Medler nearby. The degree to which it fits into space is interesting since it makes use of the air conditioner and window by giving it wings. The AC appears to be unplugged from its natural position, and its color helps to separate it from the content of the mural.",

Painted around an air conditioner, its patterns resemble electronic circuitry and the energy flowing out of the machinery. Aside from an interesting coherence with its surroundings, it is worth noting that Richert is a former Purdue student. Small Spaces has aimed, from the start, to connect with the younger residents of West Lafayette, particularly Purdue students. Pieces such as Richert’s help bridge that gap and create a connection between the cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette. Purdue and Lafayette have much different demographics and Lafayette has long sought a way to reach the students of Purdue. With continuing initiatives West Lafayette and Lafayette may soon relate to one another more than they have in the past.",

Ali had knocked Liston down with a seemingly insignificant punch that almost no one saw land, and he was yelling at Liston to get up and fight. This highly anticipated match lasted on two minutes and twelve seconds, and it is still debated how Ali won so quickly with what became known in the sports world as the “Phantom Punch.” The artwork readily draws the eye of passersby because they likely recognize the iconic pose. It provides a contrast with the nearby artwork by presenting something much more raw and gritty. It is also interesting to notice how Muhammad Ali is portrayed with a halo around his head, as if he is an angel. Consider why the artist would use such imagery.",

In the absence of artwork, holes have been punched in the wall, and scribbles from other people can occasionally be found around the space.  The stark white paint stands out against the dull bricks of the building, attracting the attention of passerby.  This piece is unique among the other artwork because it is actually the absence of any art that actually creates a place around the area.

For example, Bumgarner’s spray paint image of Muhammad Ali (artwork # 14) is much cruder and does not have the same amount of color found in this bird image. This contrast shows his versatility as an artist. Notice how the eye-catching color and patterns of the art piece manage to both contrast with the dark brick of the building, while at the same time meshing with the patterned nature of the brick.

Evidently, from her use of the buildings’ lines, Lisa was able to see the beauty and gain inspiration from a rundown, downtown building. There are several printing companies in the downtown Lafayette area, and this textile-inspired piece may remind onlookers of the artful textiles created inside of these drab buildings.",

The image depicts a man with a can of spray paint painting the piece’s title on the building. This can be compared to how all of the artists of Small Spaces left their own individual marks on their buildings through their artwork. Through this piece, Medler communicates that the art that he does is his form of social media, meaning it is how he likes to express himself to the world. The art also fits the general purpose of the Small Spaces project by showing how artists can create places by using their art.  The location of this piece is interesting because it talks about being a form of media, while itself being high up on a wall near the printing building for newspapers, yet another form of media.",

Consider the different features present on the creature: it has horns, the beak of a pelican, a feathery mane, another head emerging from its mouth, and even a strange type of tail. The piece draws your eyes away from the dumpster and parking lot that it is located in, and draws you into corner of fantasy.

Not only is it one of the largest parts of Small Spaces, it covers a majority of the wall in the alley and dwarfs the paintings and paste-ups around it. Due to its location by the entrance to the alleyway, its size, and its vibrant colors, it is clearly visible from the road and easily captures the attention of walkers and drivers alike, drawing them into the alleyway to observe it and all the artwork surrounding it.",

This piece is an illustration of the word ‘scraps’ and is made with a myriad of bright, striking colors. This piece is on the wall next to the back door of the Lafayette Theatre.

Zach is known for creating new, modern pieces from classic historical pieces, and felt this represented the backlash he received from the media negatively portraying Small Spaces. This mural is placed above several other pieces in an alley, and the eye is drawn to an array of brightly colored pieces below before reaching this piece above. Pay close attention to the writing on the paper the figure in the art is holding: it contains a twist on the historical artwork that is relevant to the Small Spaces controversy of today.",

The title and the words painted alongside the paste-up, “I did it for the LULZ,” are a common pop culture saying, which can be used to reason doing just about anything these days, even if it makes you look like a pig in tighty-whities. While many Small Spaces pieces seem to completely transform a space by bringing in elements uncommonly seen in the downtown area to the space, this piece has grungy character, which suits the space it occupies.
